<h2>Reflection</h2>
We learnt the basics of C++ in this class. C++ is a bit hard complexity, but it is versatile and has a good performance. Learning the basics of programming provides a valuable skill set and knowledge base that can greatly when implemented when creating programs.I could improve by doing more program exercises and eventually try doing bigger projects in order to gain full understanding of the programming language.
